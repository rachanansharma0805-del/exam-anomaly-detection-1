# Exam Hall Anomaly Detection System 
Project Title - Exam Hall Detection System
Problem Statement - 
Malpractice and suspicious behavior in examination halls are difficult to monitor manually.
This project aims to detect anomalous behavior in an exam hall using computer vision and
machine learning techniques.
Objective - The objective of this project is to identify abnormal or suspicious activities in an exam hall, such as unauthorized object usage or unusual movements by analyzing images or video frames.
Scope of the project -
- Detect anomalies using image-based analysis
- Focus on CNN-based autoencoder approach
- Classify behavior as Normal or Anomalous
- Suitable for academic and small-scale monitoring systems
Proposed Approach -
1. Capture exam hall images
2. Preprocess images (resize, normalize)
3. Train an autoencoder model using normal images
4. Calculate reconstruction error
5. Detect anomalies using thresholding
Tools and Technologies -
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- GitHub
- Trello
Project Management - Project tasks are planned and tracked using Trello with a weekly milestone-based approach.
